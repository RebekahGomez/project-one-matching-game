// Create a deck of cards with identifiable images
// Have the game automatically set up with the cards already shuffled, facing down
// Create functions that allow cards to be flipped over and taken off 
//   the board if they match OR flipped back automatically if they don't match
// Computer should keep track of the score
// Display whose turn it currently is
// Computer will announce the winner or if there is a tie
// Have a "reset" button that automatically shuffles the cards and disperses them facedown.
