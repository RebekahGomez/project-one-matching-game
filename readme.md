# Matching Card Game
- This currently a game is for 1 or 2 players
- There is a deck of 20 cards, 10 colors total, all cards start face down
- The objective is to find the matching pairs.
- Whichever player has the most matching pairs at the end wins.
- Link to deployed game [here](https://rebekahgomez.github.io/project-one-matching-game/)

## Initial Coding Objectives
- Create a deck of cards with different colors
- Have the game automatically set up with the cards already shuffled, facing down
- Create functions that allow cards to be flipped over and taken off 
  the board if they match OR flipped back automatically if they don't match
- Computer should keep track of the score
- Display whose turn it currently is
- Computer will announce the winner or if there is a tie
- Have a "reset" button that automatically shuffles the cards and disperses them facedown.

### Coding Objectives to Implement in the Future
- Have images instead of colors for the card faces
- Allow users to enter "Player's Name"
- Prompt the user at the beginning "Single Player mode? Play with 2 players? or Play against the computer?"
- Single-player mode - track how many turns it took to complete the game
- Functionality for user to select how many matching pairs the game starts with (easy, medium, hard mode)
- Potentially pull the images from an API
- Have users be able to select different card themes (dogs, cats, NY buildings, etc.)
- Increase difficulty (number of cards) each round
  - Ask user after each game "Next level or play again?"
  - Maybe have arrows on either side of game to go to harder level or easier level
  - Include Level Number somewhere on the screen (EG: level 3 of 20)
